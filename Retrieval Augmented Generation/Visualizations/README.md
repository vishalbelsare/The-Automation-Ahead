# Visualizations

This folder contains the code used to generate the visual assets featured in the [RAG for Finance: Automating Document Analysis with LLMs](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/the-automation-ahead-content-series/retrieval-augmented-generation) article published on the CFA Institute Research and Policy Center (RPC) website.

You can follow the "Embeddings and RAG" Jupyter Notebook if you'd like to understand how to create the code to visualize LLM embeddings and explore the Manim library. Manim is a powerful Python library for creating mathematical and scientific animations, including 2D and 3D visualizations. You might recognize the style of these animations from the popular YouTube Channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) by Grant Sanderson, who created the Manim library.
