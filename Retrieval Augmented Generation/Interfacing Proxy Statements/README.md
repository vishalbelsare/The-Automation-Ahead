# Interfacing Proxy Statements – Case Study

This folder contains a case study showing how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used to extract and summarize insights from pdf proxy statements.

If you’re curious about how RAG can help with navigating long, complex filings—this is a good place to start.

## Get Started

Open the Jupyter notebook: Interfacing Proxy Statements – Case Study.ipynb

### Key Takeaways

## By the end of this notebook, you will be familiar with:

- **Building a RAG Workflow**  
  Learn how to construct a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for extracting structured data from complex financial documents.

- **Using Computer Vision for Metadata Extraction**  
  See how tools like Mistral’s OCR API can extract structured headers from PDFs, preserving the context needed for effective document chunking and metadata tagging.

- **Incorporating Agentic Function Calling**  
  Use function calling to integrate external tools (like a calculator) into your workflow, enabling precise outputs and reducing hallucinations for numerical tasks.

- **Evaluating Outputs with LLM-as-a-Judge**  
  Understand how to scale your evaluation process by using a large language model to judge the accuracy and relevance of other LLM outputs, especially in large datasets.

- **Analyzing Executive Compensation Details From Proxy Statements Using AI**  
  Gain practical exposure to the nuances of parsing and comparing executive compensation across companies using AI-driven methods.
