# Community-Created RAG Examples for Finance

This space is dedicated to sharing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** use cases specifically within the world of **finance and investment**.

Whether you're building tools to summarize earnings calls, monitor regulatory filings, power investment research, or generate portfolio briefs‚Äîwe'd love for you to contribute.

## Purpose

This folder exists to:

* Highlight practical, finance-focused RAG workflows
* Help others get inspired by concrete implementations
* Foster community learning, experimentation, and collaboration

## What Makes a Good Finance Example?

Each contribution should aim to be:

* **Finance/Investment-Relevant**: Tied to an actual finance workflow (e.g., analyzing 10-Ks, generating macroeconomic summaries, querying fund documents, etc.)
* **Clear**: Well-documented so others can understand and replicate it
* **Self-contained**: Includes example inputs or links to publicly available data
* **Google Colab-Based**: Each submission should consist of a `README.md` file that links to an Google Colab Notebook
* **Readable**: The linked notebook should contain markdown cells that clearly explain your objective, setup, workflow, and results
* **Reproducible**: All required dependencies should be installable from within a notebook cell (e.g. using `!pip install ...`)

## üìÇ Suggested Folder Structure

Each contribution should be added in a subfolder with the following format:

```
community_examples/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_project_name/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Describes your example and links to the notebook
```
